4.1.0
~~~~~
* FIX: skipzeros now checks for zero hits instead of zero time
* FIX: Fixed errors in Python 3.11 with duplicate functions.
* FIX: ``show_text`` now increases column sizes or switches to scientific notation to maintain alignment
* ENH: ``show_text`` now has new options: sort and summarize
* ENH: Added new CLI arguments ``-srm`` to ``line_profiler`` to control sorting, rich printing, and summary printing.
* ENH: New global ``profile`` function that can be enabled by ``--profile`` or ``LINE_PROFILE=1``.
* ENH: New auto-profile feature in ``kernprof`` that will profile all functions in specified modules.
* ENH: Kernprof now outputs instructions on how to view results.
* ENH: Added readthedocs integration: https://kernprof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

4.0.3
~~~~~
* FIX: Stop requiring bleeding-edge Cython unless necesasry (for Python 3.12).  #206

4.0.2
~~~~~
* FIX: AttributeError on certain methods. #191

4.0.1
~~~~~
* FIX: Profiling classmethods works again. #183

4.0.0
~~~~~
* ENH: Python 3.11 is now supported.
* ENH: Profiling overhead is now drastically smaller, thanks to reimplementing almost all of the tracing callback in C++. You can expect to see reductions of between 0.3 and 1 microseconds per line hit, resulting in a speedup of up to 4x for codebases with many lines of Python that only do a little work per line.
* ENH: Added the ``-i <# of seconds>`` option to the ``kernprof`` script. This uses the threading module to output profiling data to the output file every n seconds, and is useful for long-running tasks that shouldn't be stopped in the middle of processing.
* CHANGE: Cython's native cythonize function is now used to compile the project, instead of scikit-build's convoluted process.
* CHANGE: Due to optimizations done while reimplementing the callback in C++, the profiler's code_map and last_time attributes now are indexed by a hash of the code block's bytecode and its line number. Any code that directly reads (and processes) or edits the code_map and/or last_time attributes will likely break.

3.5.2
~~~~~
* FIX: filepath test in is_ipython_kernel_cell for Windows #161
* ADD: setup.py now checks LINE_PROFILER_BUILD_METHOD to determine how to build binaries
* ADD: LineProfiler.add_function warns if an added function has a __wrapped__ attribute

3.5.1
~~~~~
* FIX: #19 line profiler now works on async functions again

3.5.0
~~~~~
* FIX: #109 kernprof fails to write to stdout if stdout was replaced
